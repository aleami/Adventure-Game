# 🏔️ AdventureGame-Python

Welcome to my Adventure Game 🎮! This is a text-based adventure game built in Python, where players explore different locations, interact with objects, and make choices that affect the outcome of the game.


**🤔 Purpose of the Project**

The goal of this project is to practice Python programming by developing an interactive text-based game. It helps improve skills in:

- _Control flow (loops, conditionals)_

- _Handling user input_

- _Organizing code using functions and classes_

- _Implementing game logic_


**🎮 Gameplay Overview**

In _**AdventureGame-Python**_, the player starts in a mysterious location and must explore the environment, collect items, and solve challenges to progress. The game is played entirely through text commands, where the player makes choices that influence the storyline and final outcome.


**✨ Features**

- 🏞️ Multiple Locations: Explore different areas within the game world.

- 🗣️ Interactive Choices: Players can interact with objects.

- 🛡️ Inventory System: Collect and use items to solve puzzles.

- 🎭 Branching Storylines: Different choices lead to multiple endings.

- ⌨️ Command-Based Interface: Simple text commands control the gameplay.


**🛠️ Technologies Used**

- 🐍 Python: Core programming language for game logic.


**⚙️ Setup and Installation**

_To play the game on your local machine, follow these steps:_

1️⃣ Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/aleami/AdventureGame-Python.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory: cd AdventureGame-Python

3️⃣ Run the Game: python adventure_game.py

**🖥️ How to Play**

- The game will present you with a situation and available actions.
- Type a command (e.g., help from this caracter (diffrent options on caracters), take boat etc.).
- Your choices will affect the storyline and outcomes.
- Explore different paths and try to reach the best ending!

**📜 Code Details**

_This game makes use of several important programming concepts:_

- _**Functions:**_ Organized game logic into separate functions (e.g., _kap1_text()_, _handling1()_, _travel()_).

- _**Conditional Statements (if, else, elif):**_ Used for _decision-making_ (e.g., choosing a character, selecting a boat, handling choices in the game).

- _**Loops:**_ Used for handling user input validation (e.g., ensuring the player selects a valid option for islands and boats).

- _**Dictionaries:**_ Stores character information, ships, and islands for easy lookup.

- _**Recursion:**_ Some functions call themselves (e.g., _handling1()_, _travel()_, _selectboat()_) to ensure valid input.

- _**String Formatting (.format()):**_ Used for dynamic messages when displaying character choices and money balance.

- _**Time Delays (time.sleep()):**_ Adds delays to text output for a better user experience.
